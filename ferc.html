Effects at PacWave South are expected to be minimized given that anchor installation/removal is not likely to occur more than once a year in a berth and anchors may be deployed for multi-year periods. Any effects on prey availability due to WECs or anchors (if there are any) is expected to be extremely minor, localized, short-term, and temporary, though intermittent throughout the 25- year license term.

The pontoons are 4.6 feet in diameter, which represents a very small portion of the overall cross section of the river in the project area, and would not lead to a major increase of water speed. We expect scour around the project pontoons to be negligible.  In addition, available information indicates that the majority of the riverbed is composed of coarse gravel, cobbles, and small to medium boulders, all of which require high river velocity for mobilization and are less prone to scour. The gravel, cobble, and boulders would also act as scour protection for any smaller sediment classes that may lie underneath.","Deployment and operation of the Igiugig Project has the potential to affect the presence, abundance, spatial distribution, and behavior, as well as injury and mortality, of fish and marine mammals in the Kvichak River.

To address the concerns regarding potential project effects on low-flying seabirds and migrating water birds, OPT developed an Offshore Avian Use Study Plan (Appendix C)","direct effects to the benthic community from placement of project mooring components and subsea transmission cable on the seabed","direct effects to the benthic community from placement of project mooring components and subsea transmission cable on the seabed.  scale project components, and the increase of open ocean structure that these components represent, may lead to development of artificial reefs and fish aggregation devices over a few square miles (cumulatively), thus potentially changing the marine community composition and predator/prey interactions in areas associated with the wave park footprints.","Offshore avian collision - Multiple large-scale projects would represent potential\r\nobstacles in the open ocean that could pose a higher collision risk to low-flying offshore\r\navians.","the potential for sea turtle entanglement in derelict fishing gear was of concern, if it was found to accumulate on the PowerBuoy system. It is unknown at this time to what degree the prevalence of lost or derelict gear is in the vicinity of the project and the potential for the array to collect this derelict fishing gear.","As part of the Fish and Invertebrates Study, OPT will evaluate if the project affects the local (scale: tens of meters) distribution and abundance of adult Dungeness crab (see Section 5.C.3, Marine Life; Appendix C). This will allow for determination of whether there is an effect of the project on the crab fishery.","By burying the transmission cable within the bed of an access road, OPT will minimize the terrestrial aesthetic effects of the project.OPT will conduct a Visual Assessment Review, involving viewing the project from the beach, the top of a dune near the beach, and Umpqua Lighthouse with interested members of the Recreation and Public Safety Subgroup following the installation of the first PowerBuoy, which will be deployed prior to the array.","Given the size and location of the proposed project—10 PowerBuoys and located 2.5 nautical miles offshore—and implementing measures to address navigation and public safety, at this time, the only anticipated unavoidable adverse impact of the project on recreation, ocean, and land use, is the loss of area associated with the array footprint for sport fishing, commercial fishing, and crabbing. The affected area is 30 acres (0.12 km2) plus any buffer area that fishermen and crabbers may impose to avoid entanglement of fishing gear. Although the project area does overlap with an area used for crabbing, because of the small size of the proposed array, the effect is not expected to be significant.",null,"Appropriate inspection techniques will be used to view underwater components of the project, including looking for any accumulation of derelict fishing gear on the buoy system, with the results being recorded by suitable means.","NMFS Protected Resources Division provided OPT with the following protocol for reporting injured or stranded marine mammals (email from Bridgette Lohrman, NMFS, dated April 7, 2008).

Some whale species may swim with their mouth open, and there is a specific concern that a mooring line may become lodged in the mouth of a feeding whale. In addition, subgroup members indicated concern that derelict fishing gear (abandoned/stray fishing gear) may snag on project moorings and in turn pose and entanglement risk to cetaceans.

Previous studies have identified the need to measure the response of electro-sensitive species with the characteristics and magnitude of cabling associated with off-shore energy projects (Centre for Marine and Coastal Studies 2005). Research related to these topics is currently being conducted by Collaborative Offshore Wind Energy Research Into the Environment (COWRIE) (2006), but the results of this study are not yet available.","he Aquatic Species Subgroup has raised the issue of pinnipeds using the PowerBuoy floats as haul-outs and identified the need to further define options to prevent pinnipeds from resting on the float and to evaluate their effectiveness. In addition, there is concern that if salmon are attracted to the PowerBuoys, pinnipeds may then be drawn to the area to prey on the salmon.","The installation of the transmission cable, mooring system, and PowerBuoys involves the use of heavy construction equipment including cranes, barges, tugs, and trenching equipment. The disturbance of the seabed may affect the local benthic community, specifically within the footprint of the gravity base anchors and along the cable route.","The PowerBuoy deployed in New Jersey has been onsite for a combined total of 24 months. Periodic inspections were performed both above and below the water at one- and two-month intervals. Biological growth in the form of bivalves has occurred primarily on the mooring lines. The PowerBuoy structure itself is coated with an anti-fouling paint that has been effective in deterring biological growth. The PowerBuoy array may also act as a Fish Aggregation Device (FAD) for pelagic fish and invertebrates.","Changes to the local habitat associated with the deployment of a wave energy array may attract structure-oriented fish, such as rockfish. This effect is not necessarily negative; artificial structures may benefit rockfish (Love et al. 2006) and may enhance local fisheries. However, the project does differ from many artificial reefs in that the PowerBuoy mooring structures are widely spaced in the array, the mooring lines are only 5 inches in diameter, and the anchors are located at depths of at least 204 feet (62 meters); artificial reef structures are often in shallower water. Therefore, to what degree the project structures will serve as artificial reefs is uncertain.The PowerBuoy array may also act as a Fish Aggregation Device (FAD) for pelagic fish and invertebrates.","he USFWS has noted that migratory and resident seabirds are habituated to flying through unobstructed habitats, when away from nesting and roost areas. Because the OPT PowerBuoys rise 29.5 feet above the water surface, stakeholders have raised concerns the project may result in bird injury or mortality via collision or attraction, particularly during inclement weather","Large floating objects such as WEC will potentially reflect and scatter wave energy in addition to the wave energy they absorb.

The measurements were undertaken between 17:00 and 19:00 on the 19th February 2008, a period approximately 1.5 to 3.5 hours after low water. Weather conditions were calm with wind speeds of 8 knots and a swell of approximately 0.3 m. The measurement period started just after slack water and tidal flow increased to between 4-5 knots towards the end of the measurement period.  Measurements at ranges from 50 m to 790 m indicate broadband (1Hz to 120kHz) Sound Pressure Levels from 140 to 110 dB re. 1μPa respectively. The fit to the measured data indicates a Source Level noise of 162 dB re. 1 μPa @ 1 m. This is considerably below levels of noise that may cause lethal, physical injury or hearing impairment to the species of marine mammal.","Fugro’s work scope consisted of Site Surveys of the turbine area and a possible cable route to shore, as well as data processing, interpretation, charting, and reporting.

We feel that an appropriate estimate of the number of transits through Admiralty Inlet is 42 per year (max 54, min 31). All three pods use Puget Sound, with J pod the most common, followed by K pod. Given reported pod associations during forays into Puget Sound we estimate a total of 1,442 animals transiting through Admiralty Inlet in a year. During these transits SRKW are more likely than expected to use the western side of Admiralty Inlet, although the eastern portion is used as well.

Measurements and comparison to longer time series indicate significant temporal variability in water quality on tidal, seasonal, and annual time scales. Depending on the season, there may be considerable vertical variations (stratification). Horizontal spatial variability appears to play a less significant role over the length scales being considered. In order to capture this variability a combination of long-term bottom-mounted instrumentation and short-term profiling surveys are required.","A combination of survey cruises and bottom-mounted instrumentation have been deployed in Admiralty Inlet in the region surrounding a prospective tidal energy device deployment.

The full cable specification is appended to this memo. This cable is proposed for the purposes of this study as it represents a readily-available type of cable. However, subject to budget, availability and project procurement requirements, it may be possible to obtain a more suitable four – or six-core cable for the project in Admiralty Inlet which would result in lower external magnetic fields. Therefore the study as it is presented here represents a worst-case scenario.\r\nFor the situation displayed, the field strength is equal to the threshold value of 40A/m at a distance of 40cm from the centre of the cable. Thus it is concluded that the EM field is insignificant outside a 40cm radius from the centre of the cable.","\"The SnoPUD turbine site is a dynamic and diverse geological and ecological area. Geomorphology and substrate types found at the site result from past glacial processes and present oceanographic conditions. Strong tidal currents winnowed the fine sediments leaving a cobble-pebble-small boulder lag pavement, heavily encrusted with sponge, bryozoans and tubeworms throughout the area. Locally, stringers of clean, fine grain sediment (gravel and sand) were observed and appear to be transiting through the site, transported by strong ebb tidal currents. A diverse and robust ecological community was observed during the ROV survey and some specific organisms were selected for counting in order to estimate abundances.\r\nDue to strong tidal currents, marginal visibility and irregular bottom conditions consistent elevation above the bottom and continuous even speed for transiting the ROV was not possible. Consequently, not every meter of the turbine site was video imaged. However, due to the fairly consistent substrate type and biology a good characterization of the benthic habitat was possible.

Developing accurate, data‐driven expressions for this relation is a critical research need","Physostomous juvenile Chinook salmon, an ESA-listed species, have been shown to experience a\r\nrange of injuries from very mild, such as hematoma in fins, to very severe, such as mortality from\r\nformation of gas bubbles in the gills leading to suffocation.

This project investigated the consequences on juvenile Chinook salmon from long-duration\r\n\r\nexposure to simulated tidal turbine sound.

Observations during the operation of the RITE Demonstration KHPS units also did not indicate any increased attraction of diving birds to the site, which may have been expected if the turbines impacted fish in the area.”\r\n(2)“Based on the observations made at the RITE demonstration project over an intermittent period from December 2006 through and including November 2008 Verdant Power does not believe that the project area is a particularly significant bird migration pathway for resting or feeding because of the urban nature of the location, the limited amount of green space, and the fast currents present.

A 10-meter distance would be inside the larger project installation and Or is this fine/the signals received may be inaccurate due to reflections (and other interactions) with other physical structures nearby. Therefore a greater threshold distance of 100 meters is proposed. Marine mammal detections in surveys covering the Oregon-Washington coast (Green et al. 1992) indicate a mean incidence of 0.5 animals per km2. A 100-meter radius around the device corresponds to an area of 0.03 km2 so the risk of marine mammal exposure within that area is 0.03/0.5 = 0.06 animals, or about a 6% risk in association with a day or an incident of elevated underwater sound generation.

The TidGenTM devices are small relative to the cross sectional volume of Cobscook Bay, reducing the likelihood of an encounter.\r\n2. The migratory behavior of Atlantic salmon smolts [rapid movement of individuals following tidal cycles (including smolt migration reversals) that occurs between late April and early June; inhabiting the upper water column and inshore areas away from the Deployment Area] limits the potential for interaction with the TidGenTM devices.\r\n3. Adult Atlantic salmon do not feed during spawning migration and would also be expected to pass through Cobscook Bay rapidly.\r\n4. There are extremely low numbers of returning adult Atlantic salmon through Cobscook Bay which further reduces the potential for turbine interaction.\r\n5. Atlantic sturgeon (and shortnose sturgeon) have never been reported to occur in Cobscook Bay despite extensive marine resource activities in the area and recent netting surveys. No potential spawning habitat occurs in the lower bay and the benthic habitat is dominated by hard substrate and fast tidal currents, which does not provide the preferred foraging habitat. Both sturgeon species are primarily benthic in behavior, especially when foraging and would not be in the water column in the area that the turbine foils are located. Therefore, there is a discountable chance that this species would encounter the Project.\r\n6. Adult Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon species will most likely avoid the devices using typical avoidance behavior to maneuver around obstacles in their path.\r\n  7. The inherent ability of fish to avoid colliding with larger underwater features (AECOM 2009, Coutant and Whitney 2001) and demonstrated avoidance of rotating turbine blades (Amaral et al. 2011). Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon are expected to be able to detect the presence of the turbines in the water column, avoid the turbines using typical avoidance behavior to maneuver around obstacles in their path, and thereby avoiding foil strikes. These typical avoidance maneuvers would not likely result in a negative effect on species behavior or productivity and make the risk of turbine foil strikes minimal.\r\n8. The majority of water flows around, not through, the turbine foils (Wilson et al. 2007).\r\n9. In the unlikely event that a fish interaction occurs, numerous turbine mortality studies conducted for conventional hydropower turbines have concluded that smaller fish, including Atlantic salmon smolts, have very high turbine entrainment survival rates (typically greater than 96 percent). Studies conducted on multiple hydrokinetic turbine designs to date indicate the fish friendly design of ORPC’s TGU can be expected to result in 100% survival for any salmon smolts that may be entrained (Normandeau 2009; EPRI\r\n2010; Amaral et al. 2008 and 2011).\r\n10. Turbine design characteristics that minimize risk of foil strike (slow rotation speed, large\r\nopen spacing, a blunt foil leading edge).\r\n11. The important safeguards have been developed to ensure that, in the event monitoring of\r\nthe pilot Project show that unexpected adverse effects to ESA-listed species are occurring from foil strike, the turbines can be shut down to cease turbine rotation.",null,"The E-field will be contained within the cable by grounding the outer conductor of the dual concentric power cable at the on-shore station and by the conduit. Further, the B-field component extends less than three centimeters from the center of the cable and would be negligible. Thus, there are no adverse effects on Atlantic salmon or Atlantic sturgeon (or shortnose) expected as a result of the Project. Any potential for effect would be further reduced by burying the majority of the cable will be installed two feet under the seabed, the short duration of the Project and transient occurrence of these species","The TidGenTM Power System is not expected to cause adverse effects on Atlantic salmon or Atlantic sturgeon (or shortnose sturgeon), and are expected to result in less noise than many current activities that take place in the vicinity of the Project, such as bottom trawling. ORPC believes the potential effects of underwater noise/vibration will have a negligible impact to Atlantic salmon during construction, operation, and removal given the brief exposure as salmon migrate through the project area. The noise levels associated with use of an impact hammer during construction pile driving activities may cause avoidance behavior. However, construction will be conducted outside the short migration window for Atlantic salmon smolts. As noted previously, Atlantic sturgeon have never been reported in Cobscook Bay so it is anticipated the given the short duration of the Project, expected noise levels near or below ambient levels (except for use of impact hammer) would not adversely affect Atlantic sturgeon in the extremely rare event they might occur in or near the Deployment Area.","ORPC consequently concludes that the Project effects of the alteration of habitat will be negligible to these Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon, neither species of which are known to be attracted to in-water structures in the marine environment. While ORPC anticipates that adult and juvenile Atlantic salmon and Atlantic sturgeon will be able to detect and avoid the TidGenTM device, specifically the turbines, ORPC does not expect the Project will deter these species from otherwise using or transiting the habitat in an area where marine species are already exposed to a variety of commercial uses. The very limited number of adult Atlantic salmon returns and rapid\r\n migration through the Bay further minimize risk of effect to this species.

The current Swimmer Detection Sonar Network SDSN nodes that were installed on the ORPC Beta unit operate at a frequency that is considerably lower than what would be used in a final implementation. They are also much larger and more expensive than the new node that is now under development, which will be a superior candidate for future AAM efforts. Testing performed with the current SDSN nodes, however, demonstrated the effectiveness of SSI’s AAM technology in high-current environments and showed strong detection and tracking performance over a variety of target strengths.\r\nThere were two potential issues uncovered by the testing. Firstly, we experienced periods of poor system performance during which detection and tracking failed. This could be due to entrained bubbles being swept under the barge during rough conditions and blocking sound from radiating in front of the node. Further, there were many objects tracked besides the targets during system testing. These are thought to be either seaweed, other debris, or schools of fish moving with the current.

Lone seals and small haul out locations are known in New York Harbor. Humans have also been known to harass sea mammals, and the high human population densities and development surrounding the East River would likely deter Harbor Seals from using the East River (NMFS, 2010). Harbor Seals in the East River would likely be a very rare and publicized occurrence. The rare occurrence of Harbor Seals at the mouth of the East River indicates that this is not typical habitat for the harbor seal. Therefore, the Verdant Project would not likely affect the habitat or individual Harbor Seals.","Loggerhead Turtle are not known to use the East River. Studies have consistently shown that the species migrate south following foraging habitat along the Atlantic Coast of Long Island. This has been observed from GPS tracking of sea turtles, including Loggerhead Turtle, captured in Long Island Sound (Morreale and Standora, 1998; RFMRP, 2010). The habitat in the East River is not likely suitable for foraging opportunities for the Loggerhead Turtle. Therefore, the Verdant Project would not likely affect the habitat or individual Loggerhead Turtles.Juvenile Kemp’s Ridley Turtles are known to forage in the Long Island Sound and along the Atlantic coast of Long Island; however, Kemp’s Ridley Turtle are not known to use the East River. The species likely migrate south following foraging habitat along the Atlantic Coast of Long Island. This has been observed from GPS tracking of sea turtles, including Kemp’s Ridley Turtle, captured in Long Island Sound (Morreale and Standora, 1998; RFMRP, 2010). The habitat in the East River is not likely suitable for foraging opportunities for the Kemp’s RidleyTurtle. Therefore, the Verdant Project would not likely affect the habitat or individual Kemp’s Ridley Turtles.The Green Turtles are known to forage in the Long Island Sound and along the Atlantic coast of Long Island. The foraging opportunities for this turtle are concentrated in the bays on the north side of Long Island. Similar to Kemp Ridley’s and Loggerhead Turtles, the Green Turtle migrate south or out to sea during the winter. The migration routes observed from GPS tracking show that this turtle does not use the East River (Morreale and Standora, 1998; RFMRP, 2010). The habitat in the East River is not likely suitable for foraging opportunities and therefore the Green Turtle does not use this channel as a migration route. The Verdant Project would likely not affect the habitat or individual Green Turtles because the East River does not provide suitable habitat for the Green Turtle. The leatherback turtle is a pelagic turtle. It has been observed using the open water areas of the Long Island Sound and off the coast of Long Island. The shallow channel of the East River is likely not suitable habitat for this open water species.","Adult Red Hake were collected during impingement studies at the Ravenswood plant on the Queens side of the East River. If present in the project area, adults of this species are expected to be transient, likely during the spring and fall when DO is above 4.2 mg/L, prior to winter migrations to deeper waters. The project area is likely at the upper portion of the geographic range for juveniles and adults and would constitute a small portion of the EFH for this species. Overfishing is not currently occurring for the southern stock of Red Hake, the stock that occurs within the New York/New Jersey Harbor (NMFS, 2002). No effects to EFH from the project are expected for any life stage of Red Hake.","Installation of TriFrame mounts for the turbines would disturb substrate habitat and the water column. These activities could result in a temporary increase in turbidity. However, Winter Flounder has adapted to relatively harsh estuarine conditions and can avoid highly turbid conditions that are temporary in nature. Because installation of turbines will occur over a short period of time, water quality is expected to return to existing conditions following installation. Due to current velocities within the East River dispersion of re-suspended sediments, if any, would likely occur quickly. In addition, the narrow dimensions of the proposed turbines at the site reduces the amount of habitat affected by shading, and proposed construction activities would not significantly alter the habitat used by fish. Since Winter Flounder are found in bottom habitats and the turbines are proposed to be located off the bottom, turbine strikes are not expected for this species. No impacts to EFH for Winter Flounder are anticipated from this project.","The Atlantic Herring stock complex in the northeastern United States is considered under-utilized with the exception of the portion in the Gulf of Maine (Reid et al., 1999) and is not overfished (NMFS, 2002). Habitat areas affected by the RITE Project make up a small portion of EFH for this species and potential impacts to these areas would not adversely affect the Atlantic Herring fishery. Atlantic Herring are found in the water column, are planktonic filter feeders (Collette and MacPhee, 2002) and would not be disturbed by installation of the tri- mount turbines. Impacts due to turbine strikes are not expected to be a concern for this species.

Bluefish juveniles and adults were collected during impingement studies conducted at the Ravenswood plant in the East River. No spawning would occur within the project area. Because this species is pelagic and feed on pelagic prey (Collette and MacPhee 2002), occupying open water areas and not bottom habitat, potential impacts associated with temporary increases in turbidity due to installation of the TriFrames would not be significant. Researchers have tagged and tracked Bluefish populations off the East Coast. They found that most adult Bluefish with lengths great than 45 cm are found offshore, while smaller juveniles are more likely to be inshore (Shepard et al., 2006). Habitat areas affected by the RITE Project make up a small portion of EFH for this species and potential impacts to these areas would not adversely affect the Bluefish populations.","Juvenile and adult butterfish have the potential to occur in the East River site. Adult butterfish were collected during impingement studies conducted at the Ravenswood plant in the East River. Individuals of this species are less likely to be affected by the in-water activities construction and installation than more bottom dwelling fish. Butterfish stock is not overfished or approaching an overfished condition (Cross et al., 1999, NMFS, 2002) and it is considered an underexploited fishery (Cross et al., 1999). No impacts to EFH for any life stage of Atlantic Butterfish are anticipated from this project.","Juveniles and adults are the stages of Atlantic Mackerel with the greatest potential to occur within the project areas. Spawning would not occur within this area. Habitat found within the project area does not represent a significant portion of the EFH for this species. The Atlantic Mackerel fishery is no longer considered overfished and this stock is now considered underexploited (NMFS, 2002). No impacts to EFH for any life stage of Atlantic Mackerel are anticipated from this project.","Juvenile and adult Summer Flounder are known to occur within the East River (NOAA, 2001) and have the potential to occur within project area. Summer Flounder adults were collected during impingement studies conducted at the Ravenswood plant in the East River. As discussed with respect to the other flounder EFH, Summer Flounder is a bottom dwelling species and therefore has a potential to be affected by the temporary increases in turbidity during installation of the TriFrames. As with Winter Flounder, any temporary changes associated with the project would not significantly impact this fishery since Summer Flounder are widely distributed in nearby habitats. Since Summer Flounder are found in bottom habitats and the turbines are proposed to be located off the bottom, turbine strikes are not expected for this species. No impacts to EFH for Summer Flounder are anticipated from this project.","Juvenile and adult Summer Flounder are known to occur within the East River (NOAA, 2001) and have the potential to occur within project area.

No\r\nspawning would occur within the vicinity of the project area. Adults of the species were collected during impingement studies at the Ravenswood plant in the East River. Although Scup have been collected within the vicinity of the project area the EFH for this marine species is primarily in higher salinity areas (ACOE, 1999). Because juveniles and adults tend to occur toward the bottom, in-water construction activities have the potential to temporarily impact Scup EFH during the summer and autumn. As with other bottom dwelling fish, temporary habitat changes associated with the project would not impact this fishery since these fish are widely distributed in nearby habitats and the project area constitutes a small portion of the EFH for this species. Since Scup are found in bottom habitats and the turbines are proposed to be located off the bottom, turbine strikes are not expected for this species. No impacts to EFH for Scup are anticipated from this project.","Adult Black Sea Bass prefer habitats similar to juveniles and perform similar migratory patterns. Adults also find shelter around piers (Steimle et al., 1999b). NOAA (Stone et al., 1994) indicates that adult and juvenile Black Sea Bass are rare in the mixing zone portion of the Hudson River/Raritan Bay Estuary, but are known to occur in the East River from April to November (NOAA, 2001) and, therefore, have the potential to occur within the RITE project area. Adults were collected during impingement studies at the Ravenswood plant in the East River. Black Sea Bass feed on crustaceans, fishes, and mollusks (Collette and MacPhee, 2002). The temporary increases in turbidity during the construction period in the project area should not affect this stock and the project area constitutes a small portion of the EFH for this species. Therefore, no effects to EFH are expected for any life stage of Black Sea Bass.","Adults are normally found in water with salinity ranging from 32 to 36 ppt. King Mackerel would occur\r\nonly as occasional transient individuals within the New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary system, and thus EFH for this species would not be affected by this project.","Overall, temperature and salinity are indicated as the major factor governing the distribution of this species. The northern extent of their range is near Block Island, Rhode Island, near the 20°C isotherm and the 18-meter contour. During warm years, they can be found as far north as Massachusetts. They prefer water from 21 to 27°C and are rarely found in waters cooler than 18°C. Adult Spanish Mackerel generally avoid freshwater or low salinity (less than 32 ppt) areas such as the mouths of rivers. Because this is a marine species that prefers higher salinity waters, only occasional individuals are likely to occur within the project areas. Therefore, EFH for this species would not be affected by this project.","Cobia are likely to occur only as occasional transient individuals within the project area due to its coastal migrations and salinity requirements. No effects to EFH for this species are anticipated.","This species is not expected to occur within the New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary except as an occasional transient. Therefore, it is unlikely that this species would be found in the project area and EFH for Sand Tiger Shark would not be affected by the project.","This species is not expected to occur within the New York/New Jersey Harbor Estuary except as occasional transient individuals. Therefore,\r\n it is unlikely that this species would be found in the project area and EFH for Sandbar Shark will not be affected by the project.","The East River has been designed as essential fish habitat for juvenile and adult Clearnose Skates. However, only habitats with soft bottom, rocky or gravelly substrates that occur within the shaded areas would be designated as EFH for both juveniles and adults. As noted above for other benthic fish, no significant adverse impacts are expected to occur from the installation of TriFrame mounts for the turbines, other than a temporary increase in turbidity. Because installation of turbines would occur over a short period of time, water quality is expected to return to existing conditions following installation. Due to current velocities within the East River, dispersion of re-suspended sediments would likely occur quickly.

The mechanisms mentioned are largely due to entrainment, entrapment, and entanglement with devices that have moorings, ducts, or shrouds. Please see Reference 6 for a discussion.\r\nVerdant KHPS turbines by design do not have penstocks, ducts, shrouds, intakes, or screens; and as discussed in early consultations for the RITE Project, the damage/injury to fish by water pressure change,6cavitation, shear stress or turbulence mechanisms was understood to be not applicable . In particular, the Verdant KHPS turbine rotor is designed to not cavitate under the range of operating conditions.\r\nVerdant did incorporate observation for fish/injury into the Fish Monitoring and Protection study plans during the RITE Demonstration. No effects from these mechanisms have been observed to date [FLA, Vol. 2, pg.E-96]. Blade strike as a potential damage/injury mechanism is still under study at RITE, but no evidence through 9,000 operating hours has been observed.","Can hydrokinetics cause changes in water temperature and thermal stratification or changes in dissolved gases or chemistry?\r\nGiven the extremely energetic and dynamic conditions of high velocity water necessary for the technology, thermal, or chemistry issues are unlikely at a small scale. While mixing phenomenon is important at a large scale, the literature points to concerns only when significantly larger arrays are being considered.\r\nAs discussed in the RITE FLA, mixing in the water column in high velocity water has been studied by Verdant at the micro, meso, and macro scales. The effects are extremely limited and water quality parameters are not considered an issue at the RITE site [FLA, Vol. 2, pg.E-82].\r\nThe total maximum theoretical heat input to the water from all turbine-related methods is de minimus. Any effect from both rotating and locked turbine rotors would be to increase mixing and reduce stratification, but will also be slight, relative to this already highly turbulent and well-mixed resource.","Can the machines ‘heat-up’ the water through friction?\r\nThis is primarily a theoretical question of moving machines acknowledging an ‘effect’, but at the scale of installations contemplated in the marine kinetic hydropower industry it is considered de minimus.\r\nThe transformation of mechanical to electrical energy within the turbine nacelle is associated with mechanical and electrical losses on the order of 6% of the power generated, which is ultimately rejected from the turbine as heat. Heat transfer is through the nacelle to the high velocity water at the micro scale, with volumes that result in immeasurable temperature rise in the water at the meso scale. As discussed in the RITE FLA, energy extraction or transfer is proven as an infinitesimally de minimus effect [FLA, Vol. 2, pg.E-17].","What about issues related toxicity of paints and antifouling coatings?\r\nMarine industry paints and antifouling coatings have been used for years in various applications. As noted in the literature, the type and toxicity will vary with the coating technology used. At the RITE project, the turbines have been coated with standard marine copper-based antifouling paint. Verdant is working to convert to non-toxic coatings as soon as possible, as new coating developments and application methods allow. Most likely in the medium term, the copper-based coating will be replaced by non-toxic silicone-based coatings. Please see Appendix A for KHPS design considerations. Due to these design considerations, short-term installation, and high dynamic velocities, it is generally agreed that the RITE Project does not pose any toxicity concerns.","Is there an issue with machine lubricants getting into the water?\r\nAs with any on-water activity, discharge from vessels servicing a hydrokinetic project is always a possibility during the installation and maintenance activities, but the risk is the same as any with any vessel, and precautions are in effect and spill incidents are regulated. Machine lubricants and their containment will vary widely with the hydrokinetic technology installed. Please see Reference 6 for further discussion.\r\nAt RITE, the KHPS turbine (Gen5) uses a single common circulating lubricant for its gearbox and main bearings and will contain about 34-38 liters (9-10 gal) of food-grade lubricant. This is primarily contained within the gearbox, with secondary containment by the nacelle itself. All static (o-ring) seals are redundant. The only dynamic seal, the mainshaft seal, is a dual seal assembly, with high performance face seals both containing the lubricant and excluding seawater. Between these two seals is a food-grade barrier fluid chamber. See Appendix A for KHPS design considerations.","Are there potential issues with respect to generation of electromagnetic fields (EMF)?\r\nAs discussed in the literature, EMF considerations will vary widely with the technology installed and the length, voltage and design of the underwater cables, however it is still likely to be less than existing sources of underwater cables for other power and telecommunications services. Please see Reference 6 for a discussion.",null,null,null,"The presence of Atlantic sturgeon in western Long Island Sound may indicate some movement through the East River; however, this is only one potential route between the Hudson River and Long Island Sound. Adverse effects of hydrokinetic turbines were analyzed to determine their potential to cause injury or mortality. Flow shear, rapid pressure changes, low absolute pressure, abrasion and grinding associated with fish passage through conventional hydro turbine are not of concern for most hydrokinetic designs (Amaral et al. 2010). Blade strike is expected to be the primary mechanism of injury and mortality for fish that comes into direct contact with hydrokinetic turbines. To analyze blade strike impacts on Atlantic sturgeon, a RITE project specific fish interaction model was developed. The RITE project specific fish interaction model resulted in a blade strike probability for Atlantic sturgeon at one turbine to be 0.009% for fish of common length 104 cm and burst speed of 4.16 m/s.”","“There are four species of sea turtles that are known to use the coastal waters of New York.
