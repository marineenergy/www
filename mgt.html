<p>The Management Measures tool allows users to search and query the Tethys Management Measures Tool for Marine Renewable Energy - a robust compilation of marine energy management measures identified by international Marine Renewable Energy regulators and researchers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To search for management measures, select the type of technology, category of measure, project phase, receptor and stressor of interest from the drop down menu. Note that it is possible to select multiple options for each field. As you select different technologies, categories, phases, receptors, and stressors, the table will begin to filter options as choices are selected. The total number of available entries can be found below the table.</p>

There are also questions around the effects of ADDs on sensitive species. Their addition adds another noise impact which must also be considered in any project assessments. Would rely on well proven and reliable 'detect and deter' systems. Also, mitigation against collision may prevent discovering whether or not it is a real issue.\nFurther research around ADDs which deter specific groups or species, is underway. This could be useful  in deterring  specific sensitive species or species groups, at a particular site. For example, University of St Andrews is seveloping an ADD which deter seals, but which don't effect cetaceans.","Reduces risk of contamination escaping from structure.","Reduces/removes risk of contamination from materials which may have escaped structure.
